## Summary
There does appear to be a positivity bias among Vine users as their percentage of 5-star reviews was much higher than the percentage among all of the reviews, which is represented as "percentage_total" in the screenshot above. The percentage of 5-star reviews among non-Vine users was approximately the same as the total percentage. It may also be useful to filter for verified purchases in order to ensure the accuracy of the reviews.
